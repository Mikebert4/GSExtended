If you see incoherent data, it may be because of the way GS refreshes its content. \r\n\tUsually navigate away/back from BC page fixes this.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Firefox : You need [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). ///  Chrome :  Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) \r\n\tor [NinjaKit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gpbepnljaakggeobkclonlkhbdgccfek).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Once installed, visit this link : (https://github.com/Ramouch0/GSExtended/raw/master/Js/GSExtended.user.js)\r\n3. Accept installation of the script.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to install userscripts, please visit this page : http://userscripts.org/about/installing\r\n\r\nIf eveything is ok, you should see 4 GSX notifications when you visit grooveshark.\r\n\r\nSettings\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSettings are on your profile preferences page.\r\nThey are stored locally on your computer.\r\nSome of them need a complete refresh of the page to be active.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n----\r\n**Notifications are not shown**\r\n\r\nBe sure to authorise notification for grooveshark. On your browser click on the icon on the left of the address bar.\r\nYou should see notification settings for the active site.\r\n\r\n**Songs in broadcaster's collection are not shown with green border**\r\n\r\nLarge BC collection can take a while to be loaded, come back to this page later\r\n\r\n**Some of broadcaster's friends are not highlighted in chat box**\r\n\r\nHappens if the message is displayed before the script finished to laod data. It will be fixed if you navigate in GS.\r\n\r\n**What are all this question marks in vote ?**\r\n\r\nWhen you don't have data for one user loaded on your side, the script can't know the name of the voter. it will display a '?'.\r\nBy default GS only loads your friends and people you interact with. There is an option in the script preferences to force user data loading. BUT I strongly advise to not use it when you are in a big broadcast like Caleb's (>300 listeners).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What 'Show real Votes' button does ?**\r\n\r\nIt show the number of vote from listener that are currently still listening.\r\nIt can be wrong because some listeners appear offline but they aren't... GS bug.\r\n\r\n**What the vote tooltip means?**\r\n```\r\n/Number of voter still in BC/ : /Voters/ -> /Thoses who left/\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In history, I can't see who voted**\r\n\r\nGS only gives vote number in history for songs that were played before you joined the BC. \r\nYou can only see voters' names for songs that you listened.\r\n\r\n**How to know which tracks are autovoted ?**\r\n\r\nOn songs listing you can see tracks that you marked as autovote. Currently there is now way to see a list of all autovoted songs.\r\n\r\n**Suggester name is wrong !**\r\n\r\n~~I know, it's a bug from GS. It appears when suggestion list is big (>30). It's also here when the script is not activated but less visible because suggesters are not always displayed.\r\nAnyway, the tooltip info might always be right and updated :-)\r\nI tried to find a fix for this but... (GS resuses songs views and does not update correclty the model binding)~~\r\nThis should be fixed by now. I'm forcing the first voter as suggester. This can be wrong if the suggester removed his vote, but this is also how GS shows it.\r\n\r\n**Can I change notification duration ?**\r\n\r\nOn firefox it's handled by the browser and CANNOT be changed. \r\nOn chrome it's setted to 3,5sec. You can change it by hand. Modify and run this script in javascript console then reload.\r\n```javascript\r\nvar s = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('gsx'));\r\ns.notificationDuration = 3500; // <---------------------your duration in ms\r\nlocalStorage.setItem('gsx',JSON.stringify(s))\r\n```\r\nYes, I could add a setting for that... I'm lazy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
